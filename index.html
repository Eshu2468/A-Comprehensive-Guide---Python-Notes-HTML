<h1>Python Introduction</h1>

<hr>

<p> <br>
        * Python is a powerful and beginner-friendly programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 and officially released in 1991.<br>
        * Guido developed Python during his free time over the holidays while working at a research institute in the Netherlands. <br>
        * The name "Python" doesn't come from the snake but from Guido's favorite comedy show, "Monty Python's Flying Circus". <br>
        * He wanted the language to be fun and easy to use, just like the show.<br>

<h2>Python version :</h2>

<p>
    * Python became popular because of its simple and readable syntax, which looks a lot like regular English. <br>
* Over time, it has evolved through various versions. The first version, Python 1.0, was released with basic features like functions and exception handling. <br>
* In 2000, Python 2.0 introduced advanced tools like list comprehensions and automatic memory cleanup. <br>
* Later, in 2008, Python 3.0 made the language cleaner and more efficient, though it wasn’t backward-compatible with older versions. <br>
* Today, Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world

<h2>Applications of Python:</h2>
* Python is incredibly versatile and is used in many fields. <br> 
* It is popular for web development, where frameworks like Django and Flask help build websites. <br>
* In data science and machine learning, Python is the top choice, with powerful libraries like Pandas and TensorFlow. <br>
* It is also used for automation, helping to write scripts that can save time by performing repetitive tasks automatically. <br>
* Python is even used in game development, desktop applications, and IoT (Internet of Things), making it a tool that fits almost every need. <br>

<hr>

<h2>IDE Tools to use Python:</h2>
<p>* IDE is Integrated Development Environment.<br>
* It is a software application that provides tools like a code editor, debugger, and compiler/interpreter in one interface, making programming easier and more efficient.<br></p>

<hr>

<h2>Python IDE Tools:</h2>
<p>* PyCharm <br>
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code) <br>
* Jupyter Notebook <br>
* IDLE<br>
* Thonny<br>
* Spyder<br>
* Atom<br>
* Sublime Text<br>
* Anaconda<br>
* Wing IDE</p>


<h2>Python Scripting</h2>
<p>* Python scripting refers to writing Python code that automates tasks, processes data, or performs specific actions. <br>
* Unlike full-fledged software development, scripting focuses on creating scripts—short programs meant to execute a series of instructions or automate a task efficiently.<br>
</p>

<h2>Common Applications of Python Scripting</h2>

<p>
    
<ol>
    <li>System Administration:<br>Automating file operations, running system commands, or managing servers.
Example: Renaming multiple files in a folder.<br></li>
<li>Data Processing:<br>
Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.
Example: Reading CSV files, applying calculations, and saving results.<br></li>
<li>Web Scraping:<br>
    Extracting data from websites.
    Example: Scraping product prices from e-commerce sites.<br></li>
<li>API Interaction:<br>
Automating API calls for data retrieval or updates.
Example: Fetching weather data from an API.<br></li>
<li>Testing and Debugging:<br>
Writing test cases for software and debugging issues.</li>
<li>Task Automation:<br>
Scheduling and running periodic tasks.
Example: Sending automated email reminders.<br></li>
<li>Machine Learning and AI:<br>
Running training scripts for models.
Example: Automating data preprocessing and model evaluation.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Python Interactive Mode (REPL)</h2>
<ol>
    <li>R: Read – It reads the code or input you type.</li>
    <li>E: Evaluate – It evaluates the code or expression.</li>
    <li>P: Print – It displays the result of the evaluation.</li>
    <li> L: Loop – It goes back to accept more input in a loop.</li>
</ol>
