## Arithmetic Operators in Python:
* Addition (+) : Adds two operands.
a=1

b=2

result = a+b

print(result)

* Subtraction (-) : Subtracts the second operand from the first.
a=1

b=2

result = a-b

print(result)

* Multiplication (*) : Multiplies two operands

a=1

b=2

result = a*b

print(result)

* Division (/) : Divides the first operand by the second and returns a float.

a=1

b=2

result = a/b

print(result)

* Floor Division (//) : Divides the first operand by the second and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.

a=1

b=2

result = a//b

print(result)

* Modulus (%) : Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.

a=1

b=2

result = a%b

print(result)

* Exponentiation (**) : Raises the first operand to the power of the second.

a=1

b=2

result = a**b

print(result)

## Logical Functions in Python

* Logical AND (and): Returns True if both operands are true.
 a = True

b = False

result = a and b  # result is False

* Logical OR (or): Returns True if at least one of the operands is true.
a = True 

b = False 

result = a or b

* Logical NOT (not): Returns True if the operand is false and vice versa.

a = True 

result = not a # result is False
