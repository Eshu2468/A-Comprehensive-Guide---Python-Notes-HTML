<h1>Python Data Type</h1>
<p>
    There are two types of data types in python mentioned below:
</p>

<h2>1. Primitive Data Types:</h2>Primitive data types are the most basic data types available within a programming language. These types are predefined by the language and are used to represent simple values.
<ol>
    <li>Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without a fractional part.</li>
    <li>Floating-point (float): Represents numbers with a fractional part (decimals).</li>
    <li>Character (char): Represents a single character (e.g., 'a', 'b', '1', '$').</li>
    <li>Boolean (bool): Represents true or false values (True or False in Python)</li>

</ol>
In Python, these include:
<li>int: For integers.</li>
<li>float: For floating-point numbers.</li>
<li>bool: For boolean values.</li>
<li>str: For strings (though in some languages, str is not considered a primitive type).
</li>





<h2>2. Non-Primitive Data Types:</h2> 
Non-primitive data types are more complex and are derived from primitive data types. They are used to store multiple values or collections of values.

<ol>
In Python, non-primitive data types include:
<li>list: Ordered and mutable sequences of elements.</li>
<li>tuple: Ordered and immutable sequences of elements.</li>
<li>set: Unordered and mutable collections of unique elements.</li>
<li>frozenset: Unordered and immutable collections of unique elements.</li>
<li>dict: Collections of key-value pairs.</li>

</ol>

<p><h2>Comment Lines in Python</h2>
Comment lines are lines of text in a code file that the Python interpreter ignores. They are used to explain and annotate the code, making it more understandable for anyone reading it, including your future self.

<h2>Why we need to use Comment lines?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Clarify Code Functionality:Explain what specific parts of the code are doing.</li>
    <li>Provide Context: Offer background information or the purpose of certain sections of the code.</li>
    <li>Improve Readability: Make the code more readable and easier to follow.</li>
    <li>Debugging: Temporarily disable certain parts of the code without deleting them.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Types of Comments in Python</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Single-line Comments ===>  # </li>
    example: <br>
    
    <li>Multi-line comments ===> """ or '''</li>
